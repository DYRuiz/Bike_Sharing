Over 2 million trips were analyzed.  
- Most of rides were taken by subscribers to the bikeshare service, the majority of which were men.  
- The most popular checkout times were between 8am - 10am and from 4pm to 8pm on weekdays
- There was no significant difference in peak hours between genders
- Popular checkout times on the weekends was more evenly distributed throughout the day and between genders
- Most trips taken were under 30 minutes

Summary:

Trip concentration was heaviest around the busier parts of the city and during peak commute hours.  This would suggest that the majority of rides taken by subscribers were for daily work commutes.  Further analysis of the locational trends for non-subcribers around tourist attractions and other points of interest would provide more insight on ways to increase usage among that demographic.  Analysis of bikeroutes and accessiblity would also provide valuable insight on future feasibility.
